# cg-python-carparking-space-detection--
The car parking space detection project  a computer vision system designed to detect the availability of parking spaces in a parking lot in real-time. The system is based on the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm and requires a dataset of parking lot images with labeled parking spaces.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect the number of available parking spaces in real-time, which can be used to optimize parking lot management and improve user experience. The project consists of the following components:

Dataset: A dataset of parking lot images with labeled parking spaces.
Preprocessing: Normalization of the dataset to improve the accuracy and performance of the YOLO algorithm.
Training: Training themodel on the preprocessed dataset using a deep learning framework such as Darknet or TensorFlow.
Testing and Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) and intersection over union (IoU).
Real-time Detection: Deploying the model for real-time detection of parking spaces in a video stream or a camera feed.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3
OpenCV
NumPy
cvzone and
configuration files
You can install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

Usage
To run the car parking space detection system, you can use the following command:

python detect_parking.py --input [input video file or camera index] --output [output video file] 
For example:

 python detect_parking.py --input 0 --output output.avi
This will detect parking spaces in the camera feed from camera index 0 and save the output video to a file named output.avi.
